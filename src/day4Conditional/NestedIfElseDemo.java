		 // like if the requested withdrawal amount is within the daily limit and if the account balance is sufficient.
	
	// 2. Employee Bonus Based on Performance and Years of Service
		// In a company, employees get a bonus based on their performance rating and years of service. 
		// Employees with higher ratings and more years of service get bigger bonuses.
	
	// 3. Ticket Pricing Based on Age and Day of the Week
		// In a cinema, ticket prices vary based on age (child, adult, or senior citizen) and 
		// whether it's a weekday or weekend. 	
		
	// 4.  Credit Card Approval Based on Income and Credit Score
		// A bank uses nested conditions to determine if a customer is eligible for a credit card based 
		// on their income and credit score.
